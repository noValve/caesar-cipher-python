# Caesar Cipher Python
The Caesar Cipher, an early encryption technique, replaces plaintext letters 
with others shifted by a fixed number (key) in the alphabet. Named after Julius 
Caesar, it laid the foundation for modern cryptography.

## Installation 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:noValve/caesar-cipher-python.git
```

## Usage  
```bash
# Place yourself inside the project folder
cd caesar-cipher-python

# Run the script
python3 caesar_cypher.py
```  

After that, a list of options shows up:
- 1 - To cipher a given message with a certain shift.
- 2 - To decipher a given message using the known shift.
- 3 - To bruteforce the decryption of the message (when the shift isn't known).
